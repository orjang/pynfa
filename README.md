# pynfa
Pure python implementation of an NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton)

This is very much a work in progress for now.
I am writing pynfa as a vehicle for self education. If anyone should find this code useful I'd be very happy to hear about it.

As such it is of course very much _as is_ and the only guarantee I can give is that it may break at any time as I implement new features. *You have been warned* :)
